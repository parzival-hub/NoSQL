# NoSQL Scanner and extractor

Disclamer: Still in early dev.

This tool was made while completing the Senior Web Penetration Tester Job role Path from HackTheBox, because no other tool could find and exploit the configuration in the exercise.

Features:
- Automatic extraction of a target HTML form from a URL
- Automatic scanning for NoSQL vulnerabilities
- Automatic data enumeration and extraction
